# PlayReady Overview

## Secure audio/video content against unauthorized use, and help monetize content

**Microsoft PlayReady content access and protection technology** is a set of technologies that can be used to distribute audio/video content more securely over a network, and help prevent the unauthorized use of this content. This technology is used for defining, incorporating, and enforcing rights for digital media. The service provider and content provider can control the expiration date, the number of times a user can play the content file, the resolution of the content that can be played on a screen, the type of screen that content is rendered to, and many other control settings. PlayReady technologies can be incorporated into media applications on televisions, set-top boxes, mobile phones, tablets, personal computers, and other devices to enforce the content access rules defined by the content owners.
